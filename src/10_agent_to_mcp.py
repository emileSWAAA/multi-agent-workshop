Restaurant Booking Agent with MCP Integration

This script demonstrates how to create and interact with a conversational AI agent
that helps users find restaurants, check menus, and make reservations. The agent
leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugins to provide specialized functionality.

The script sets up a Semantic Kernel-based agent with two MCP-based plugins:
1. Menu Plugin - Provides information about restaurant menus and specials
2. Booking Plugin - Handles restaurant reservation requests

Features:
- Interactive conversation loop with natural language processing
- Integration with Azure OpenAI services for language understanding
- Plugin-based architecture for modular functionality
- Thread-based conversation management for context preservation

Usage:
- Run the script and interact through the command line
- Ask about available restaurants, menu items, prices, or make bookings
- Type 'exit' to end the conversation

Requirements:
- Azure OpenAI API credentials in environment variables
- Proper configuration in settings.llm_config
- MCP plugin servers in the 'servers_mcp' directory

Example conversation flow:
1. User asks about available restaurants
2. User inquires about menu specials
3. User requests pricing information
4. User makes a reservation request
5. Agent confirms booking details

The script demonstrates modern agent architecture with plugin integration,
providing a practical example of building conversational AI applications.
