    EXERCISE: Building Coding Agents

    In this exercise, you'll implement a system with two agents that can write and execute code:
    1. A code writer agent that proposes Python code solutions
    2. A code executor agent that runs the proposed code

    Your task is to:
    - Create a system message for the code writer agent
    - Set up a local command line executor
    - Create the necessary agents
    - Configure a round-robin team for the agents to collaborate
    - Implement a termination condition
    
    The goal is to have these agents solve a coding task (calculating the 14th Fibonacci number)
    through collaboration.

    # - Suggest Python code or shell scripts when needed
