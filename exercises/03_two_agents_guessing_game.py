    EXERCISE: Complete the guessing game between two agents
    
    In this exercise, you will implement a number guessing game where:
    1. A random number between 1-100 is generated
    2. Two agents take turns: one tries to guess the number, the other provides feedback
    3. The game ends when the number is correctly guessed
    
    Follow the TODO comments to complete the implementation.
