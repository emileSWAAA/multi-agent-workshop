    EXERCISE: Implement a conversation between two agents (Chandler and Joey) who exchange jokes.

    Complete the following tasks:
    1. Load environment variables and create a ChatCompletionClient
    2. Create two AssistantAgents with appropriate system messages
    3. Set up a termination condition for the conversation
    4. Create a RoundRobinGroupChat team with the two agents
    5. Run the conversation and display the result
    6. Reset the team and run another conversation as a stream

    Refer to the instructions in the comments for each step.
